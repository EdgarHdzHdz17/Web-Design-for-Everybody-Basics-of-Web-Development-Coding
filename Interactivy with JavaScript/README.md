Interactivy with JavaScript
<p align="justify">
This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input.

This is the third course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class.
