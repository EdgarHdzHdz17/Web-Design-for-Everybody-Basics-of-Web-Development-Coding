Introduction to CSS3

The web today is almost unrecognizable from the early days of white pages with lists of blue links.  Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.   This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.     

When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page.   When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all.    To ensure that your sites do not put up  barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.    Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and  layouts.    

This is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.   Subsequent courses focus on adding interaction with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.
